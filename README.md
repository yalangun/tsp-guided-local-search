Features:
- Greedy nearest-neighbor initialization
- Multi-start strategy for solution diversity
- Candidate-based 2-opt local search
- Guided Local Search (GLS) with edge penalization
- Iterated Local Search via perturbation (double-bridge, strong kick)
- Time-bounded optimization (anytime algorithm behavior)
- Scalable to 500+ cities
